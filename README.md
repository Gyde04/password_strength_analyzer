# Password Strength Analyzer

## Overview
A Python-based security tool that analyzes password strength using multiple criteria to help users create more secure passwords. This tool evaluates passwords based on length, complexity, common patterns, and known vulnerable passwords.

## Features
- Password length validation
- Character complexity checking (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Common password pattern detection
- Dictionary attack resistance checking
- Strength score calculation
- Detailed feedback and improvement suggestions

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install re
  pip install string
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password_strength_analyzer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd password_strength_analyzer
   ```
3. Run the program
   ```bash
   python password_analyzer.py
   ```

## Usage
```python
# Import the analyzer
from password_analyzer import PasswordStrengthAnalyzer

# Create an analyzer instance
analyzer = PasswordStrengthAnalyzer()

# Check password strength
result = analyzer.analyze_password("YourPassword123!")

# Get the results
print(result['score'])        # Prints the strength score (0-100)
print(result['feedback'])     # Prints detailed feedback
```

## Password Strength Criteria
- **Length**: Minimum 8 characters recommended
- **Complexity**:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- **Common Patterns**: Checks for:
  - Keyboard patterns (qwerty, 12345)
  - Repeated characters
  - Sequential patterns

## Score Interpretation
- 0-20: Very Weak
- 21-40: Weak
- 41-60: Moderate
- 61-80: Strong
- 81-100: Very Strong

## Example Output
```
Password: "Example123!"
Score: 75/100
Feedback:
✓ Good length
✓ Contains uppercase letters
✓ Contains lowercase letters
✓ Contains numbers
✓ Contains special characters
! Consider avoiding common word patterns

## Security Considerations
- This tool is for educational purposes
- Never store or log actual passwords
- Use secure password hashing in production environments
- Regular updates recommended for security patterns
